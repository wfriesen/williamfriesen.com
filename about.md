### Here

This is my development-related blog. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

I intend for this to be part journal, part technical resource. Relevant topics for posts will be anything that I was not able to find with a cursory Google and instead had to figure out on my own. By putting it here it is then Google-able, if not for others then at least for my future self.

### Me

I was born in 1986, which makes me roughly <span id="age">an unknown number of</span> years old according to your web browser.

I was born in Albury and moved to Canberra after university, which of course means that I work for the government in some capacity.

My main interests lie in technology, in particular web development, linux, and open source software.

Outside of tech, and the usual "I like movies"-type descriptions that apply to all people, I also enjoy 19th century Russian literature, and 20th century American death metal. The order differs depending on what kind of day I've had.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var age = Math.floor((new Date() - new Date('1986/02/20')) / (1000*60*60*24*365.25));
  document.getElementById('age').innerHTML = age;
</script>
